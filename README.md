# Generative AI Tasks

This repository contains various Python scripts and notebooks that I use to practice and refine my skills in generative AI. The tasks focus on different aspects of generative models and their applications in natural language processing, image generation, and other fields.

## Contents

- **Text Generation:** Python scripts for experimenting with language models like GPT and LLaMA to generate coherent text based on prompts.
- **Image Generation:** Files exploring image generation using GANs, VAEs, and other techniques.
- **Fine-tuning Models:** Examples of fine-tuning pre-trained models on custom datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts for preparing and cleaning datasets for training generative models.
- **Performance Analysis:** Tools to evaluate the output and performance of generative models.

## Technologies

- **Python**
- **Transformers Library**
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow**
- **Hugging Face** for pre-trained models
